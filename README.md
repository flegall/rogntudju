# rogntudju

A useless re-render detector for react/redux apps

It comes with two packages :

- A checker HOC that you can use with any react app : https://github.com/flegall/rogntudju/tree/master/packages/checker
- A `connect()` factory that decorates react-redux's `connect()` : https://github.com/flegall/rogntudju/tree/master/packages/connect
